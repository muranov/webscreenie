WebScreenie is small qt utility to create snapshot of webpages.

It has a command-line interface (CLI) and work is currently in progress for a GUI.

Its aim is to remain simple (not become an image editor but rather simply take screenshots) yet very powerful, notably with scripted events and automation.
