#Instruction for building / installing webscreenie

= Prerequisite =

== For qmake ==

  * Qt 4.5+

== For cmake ==

  * Qt 4.5+
  * cmake 2.6+

= Getting the source =

The source is available through svn (subversion) on google code. The project url is:
https://webscreenie.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

= Building with qmake =

qmake is the build utility for Qt. A project file (.pro) is provided with webscreenie so building with qmake is very straightforward:

  # "cd" to the root of the source
    * cd /home/myuser/src/webscreenie
  # Create a temporary build directory
    * mkdir build
    * cd build
  # Create the MakeFile with qmake
    * qmake ../webscreenie.pro
  # Build the project with make
    * make
  # That's all. You should have a compiled binary named "webscreenie" in your build directory

Run webscreenie --help for more information about the command line options

= Building with cmake =

Alternately, a cmake file is also provided if you prefer to build the project using cmake:

  # "cd to the root of the source
    * cd /home/myuser/src/webscreenie
  # Create a temporary build directory
    * mkdir build
    * cd build
  # Create the Makefile with cmake
    * cmake ..
  # Build the project with make
    * make
  # That's all. You should have a compiled binary named "webscreenie" in your build directory

Run webscreenie --help for more information about the command line options
